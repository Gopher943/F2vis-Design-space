## Abstract

	Humans encounter a vast array of sensory stimuli in their everyday lives. However, many visualization techniques primarily utilize visual feedback, which may disregard certain intricate details. Relying on a single visual channel may overlook complex layouts. However, how haptic force feedback can be used to assist visualization remained under-explored. In this work, we initially engaged in discussions with domain experts to explore the potential of haptic force feedback and visual collision representation, and we conducted a literature review to identify potential problems in the visualization of large datasets. Subsequently, we designed an innovative haptic force feedback knob, which included 3 primary modules and 29 elements. To evaluate the clarity and usefulness of this design space, we conducted a workshop and devised ``recommended solutions'' for the identified visualization problems. Finally, we implemented a prototype of the haptic force feedback knob and assessed its performance in scatterplot problems using large datasets. The results indicated that the knob prototype could reduce visual strain and enhance the efficiency of visualization tasks.
